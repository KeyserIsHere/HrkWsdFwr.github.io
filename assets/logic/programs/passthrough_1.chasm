# 1-Byte Passthrough
# Passes 1 byte from one device to the next.
#
# This is intended to be a standalone program that runs indefinitely.
# ----------------------------------Defines----------------------------------
# Define: passthrough_count:
# As the number of out ports that are available. Maximum this can be is 255.
# -----------------------------------Ports-----------------------------------
# Port(255): passthrough_in:
# Is the port that data is read from.
#
# Port(0 - 254): passthrough_out:
# Is the pool of ports data is sent to. Starts at port 0 and goes up to port
# 'passthrough_count - 1'.
# ----------------------------------Details----------------------------------
# To guarantee efficient passing of data, the program cycles through the out
# ports.
