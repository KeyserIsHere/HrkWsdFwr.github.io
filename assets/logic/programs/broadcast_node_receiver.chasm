# Broadcast Node Receiver
# Receives packets from the transceiver and stores them in a buffer for later
# processing.
#
# This is intended to be a standalone program that runs indefinitely.
# ----------------------------------Defines----------------------------------
# Define: broadcast_node_receiver_buffer_count:
# As the number of buffers that are connected to it. Maximum this can be is
# 127.
# -----------------------------------Ports-----------------------------------
# Port(0): broadcast_node_receiver_packet_processor:
# Is the port to the device that will be reading from the buffers. The device
# should be connected to the buffers in the same order that this program is.
# The device will be sent an empty message when it should start reading from
# the next buffer ((index + 1) % count).
#
# Port(1): broadcast_node_receiver_transceiver:
# Is the port that gets a packet from a transceiver module. This should be
# set to the appropriate port/channel it should be using.
#
# Port(2 - 128): broadcast_node_receiver_buffer_start:
# Is the port connected to the buffer's 'buffer_in' port.
# 'broadcast_node_receiver_buffer_count - 1' ports should be connected to
# each buffer from this initial port (starting from 2, up to 128).
#
# Port(129 - 255): broadcast_node_receiver_buffer_control_start:
# Is the port connected to the buffer's 'buffer_control' port.
# 'broadcast_node_receiver_buffer_count - 1' ports should be connected to
# each buffer from this initial port (starting from 129, up to 255). The
# connections should be in the same order as
# 'broadcast_node_receiver_buffer_start'. A buffer at port 129 should be the
# same one connected to port 2.
